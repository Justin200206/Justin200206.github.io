     <!--  My specific design decisions -->
     <div class="bottom-left">
        <p> In the dynamic world of Web browsing, user experience plays a critical role in determining the success of a browser. To create an engaging, playful and enjoyable browsing experience, 
            I presented an animal-themed web browser that integrates interesting feedback into user interactions, where users not only learn about the characteristics of different animals, but also get a sense of enjoyment from them. 
            After listening to the instructor's discussion, special attention was paid to the navigation bar. Designed with interesting feedback in mind,
            each element in the navigation bar responds to the user's actions, thus creating a sense of responsiveness and interactivity, giving you an immediate sense of engagement as you navigate through the site's content. 
            This design decision was made to engage users with interactive elements inspired by the animal kingdom, fostering a sense of enjoyment and exploration.
            Based on the theme of animals, my web browser incorporates interesting feedback to enrich user interaction. 
            Feedback is an essential element in interaction design as it provides a sense of control and responsiveness to the user. 
            By injecting interesting feedback into user actions, such as animated effects in the navigation bar, an enjoyable browsing experience is created that keeps users engaged and eager to explore further.
            To enhance user engagement and provide instant feedback, my web browser incorporates animations and sound effects that correspond to user interactions.
            When a user hovers over an animal icon in the navigation bar, the icon may appear as an interesting animation effect. In addition,
            subtle animal-inspired sound effects, such as a purring cat and a majestic lion, can be triggered to further enhance the auditory experience.
            These visual and auditory cues create a sense of interactivity and make the browsing experience more enjoyable and immersive.
            I also integrated a collection of fascinating animal photos from Pinterest.
            These stunning visuals were carefully selected from a variety of photographers and contributors on the platform,
            adding a vibrant and captivating element to the overall content, by incorporating these captivating animal photos into the project, I aimed to create an emotional connection between the audience and the natural world. And importantly,  while the photos themselves came from Pinterest,
            by adhering to ethical guidelines and giving proper credit to the original creators.
            I aimed to ensure that the project respected the rights of others and encouraged continued sharing of creative content. Through the power of these images,
            I aspire to inspire curiosity and compassion in the audience. With audio from freesound.com and informational text from Wikipedia, 
            I aimed to create an immersive content that was rich and engaging for the audience. To enrich the aural part of the project, 
            I acquired audio clips from the famous platform freesound.com. The platform offers a wide range of quality audio resources contributed by talented creators. 
            For the text, I turned to Wikipedia as a reliable source of information. By using the text from Wikipedia articles, I ensured the accuracy and credibility of the content.
